2)    Predicted throughput: 17.68 Mbps
      Predicted latency: 123.6 ms
      Actual throughput: 17.68 Mbps
      Actual latency: 122.839
      Explanation of results: The predicted latency I calculated from the latencies between each of the of links
                              between h1 and h10. I predcited that the throughput would be the minimum throughput
                              of the links between h1 and h10.

3.1)  Predicted throughput: 8.84
      Predicted latency: 123.6
      Actual throughput: 10.232
      Actual latency: 123
      Explanation of results: I predicted that the throughput would be about halved from Q2, and I predicted that
                              the latency would be unchanged.

3.2)  Predicted throughput: 5.89
      Predicted latency: 123.6
      Actual throughput: 5.84
      Actual latency: 123
      Explanation of results: I predicted that the throughput would be about a third of that from from Q2, and 
                              I predicted that the latency would be unchanged.

4)    Predicted throughput: h3-h8 throughput of 16.6, h1-h10 throughput of 8.3
      Predicted latency: h3-h8 latency of 31, h1-h10 latency of 122
      Actual throughput: h3-h8 throughput of 16.656 Mbps, h1-h10 throughput of 7.584 Mbps
      Actual latency: h3-h8 latency of 32, h1-h10 latency of 122
      Explanation of results: I predicted the throughput of h3-h8 would be about double that of h1-h10, and
                              I predicted that they would add up to about 25 because of L4's bandwidth. h3-h8
                              has a higher throughput, because it only has to travel through L2 before it gets
                              to L4, whereas the other path goes through L1 and L2, and L1 has a much lower
                              bandwidth. I predicted that the latencies would simply be the sum of the latencies
                              of the links of each of the paths.
