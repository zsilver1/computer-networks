The format of my submission is:

assignment4/
  exercise1/
    assignment4_src/
      commands.txt
      p4src/
        source_routing.p4
  exercise2/
    assignment4_src/
      commands.txt
      kv.py
      recieve.py
      p4src/
        source_routing.p4


In order to run part 2, open two terminals on h1, and run recieve.py on one
and kv.py on the other. kv.py will allow you to enter commands, and the responses
from the switch will be printed by recieve.py on the other terminal.
